#AI/ML Intern Assignment

Welcome to the AI/ML Intern assignment! This project is designed to test your core Python skills and your ability to design and build a clean and efficient system from scratch.

## Quick Start

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the trigram-assignment/src/ngram_model.py file and implement the TrigramModel class.
4. Run the tests to check your implementation: `pytest trigram-assignment/tests/test_ngram.py`


## Instructions

1. Any changes to env should be updated in `requirements.txt`.
2. Mention the steps to run your code in `trigram-assignment/README.md`.
3. Feel free to make any changes to the existing code.
4. Please document your design choices in the `evaluation.md` file. This should be a 1-page summary of the decisions you made and why you made them. And all the steps to for us to test.
5. Please mind the second task is optional.



For more detailed instructions, please refer to the `ASSIGNMENT.md` file.
